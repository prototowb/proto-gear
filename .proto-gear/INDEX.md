# Proto Gear Capabilities Index

> **For AI Agents**: This is the master catalog of available capabilities.
> Read this file to discover what patterns and workflows are available.

## Quick Navigation

- [Skills](#skills) - Modular expertise (1 available)
- [Workflows](#workflows) - Multi-step processes (1 available)
- [Commands](#commands) - Single actions (1 available)
- [Agents](#agents) - Specialized patterns (0 available)

## Skills

Modular, reusable expertise in specific domains:

| Skill | Description | Relevance | Status |
|-------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| [testing](skills/testing/SKILL.md) | TDD methodology with red-green-refactor cycle | When writing tests, implementing features, fixing bugs | Stable |

## Workflows

Complete processes for multi-step tasks:

| Workflow | Steps | Duration | Relevance |
|----------|-------|----------|-----------|
| [feature-development](workflows/feature-development.md) | 7 | 2-4h | Building new features from concept to deployment |

## Commands

Single-action patterns:

| Command | Purpose | Dependencies |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| [create-ticket](commands/create-ticket.md) | Create documented ticket in PROJECT_STATUS.md | PROJECT_STATUS.md |

## Agents

Specialized agent patterns:

*No specialized agents included in this configuration.*

To add specialized agent patterns (backend, frontend, testing, devops, security), re-run `pg init` with the `--with-agents` option.

## Discovery Workflow

**For AI Agents**: When starting a task:

1. **Read this INDEX.md** to see available capabilities
2. **Match task to capabilities** using relevance descriptions
3. **Check dependencies** for required capabilities
4. **Load relevant capabilities** by reading their files
5. **Follow patterns** using native tools (git, pytest, npm, etc.)

## Integration with Core Templates

This capability system **extends** Proto Gear's core templates:

- **AGENTS.md** - Core agent configuration, extended by `.proto-gear/agents/`
- **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Single source of truth, updated by commands
- **BRANCHING.md** - Git workflow, detailed in `skills/git-workflow/`
- **TESTING.md** - TDD patterns, detailed in `skills/testing/`

## How to Use Capabilities

### For AI Agents

When you need to perform a task:

1. **Start here**: Read this INDEX.md to discover what's available
2. **Match your task**: Find capabilities that match what you need to do
3. **Load the capability**: Read the specific .md file for detailed patterns
4. **Follow the pattern**: Use your native tools (git, pytest, npm) as described
5. **Update status**: Use commands to update PROJECT_STATUS.md

### For Human Developers

Capabilities are designed to help AI agents, but humans can benefit too:

- Browse capabilities to understand available workflows
- Reference patterns when you're unsure how to approach a task
- Customize capabilities to match your team's conventions
- Add new capabilities for domain-specific needs

## Adding Custom Capabilities

You can extend this system by adding your own capabilities:

1. Follow the naming conventions in each directory
2. Use the YAML frontmatter format for metadata
3. Write clear, actionable patterns using natural language
4. Reference native tools (git, npm, pytest) rather than Proto Gear-specific commands
5. Update the relevant INDEX.md file to list your new capability

## Need More Capabilities?

This is a minimal set. For a complete capability library including:
- Additional skills (git-workflow, debugging, performance, security)
- More workflows (bug-fix, refactoring, performance-optimization)
- Additional commands (run-tests, update-status, create-branch)
- Specialized agents (backend, frontend, testing, devops, security)

Run: `pg init --with-capabilities=full`
