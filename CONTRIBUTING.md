## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

{{PREREQUISITES}}

### First-Time Contributors

If this is your first contribution:

1. **Fork the repository** (if applicable)
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone {{REPOSITORY_URL}}
   cd 
   ```
3. **Set up development environment**: See [Development Setup](#development-setup)
4. **Find an issue**: Look for issues tagged `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`
5. **Ask questions**: Don't hesitate to ask for clarification

## Development Setup

### Local Environment

{{SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS}}

### Verify Setup

After setup, verify everything works:

```bash
{{VERIFY_COMMAND}}
```

**Expected Output**: {{EXPECTED_OUTPUT}}

## Making Contributions

### Workflow Overview

```
1. Create issue (if not exists) →
2. Create branch →
3. Make changes →
4. Add tests →
5. Run tests →
6. Commit →
7. Push →
8. Create PR →
9. Address review →
10. Merge
```

### Step 1: Create or Find an Issue

Before starting work:

1. **Check existing issues**: Search for related issues
2. **Create new issue** (if needed):
   - Use issue templates (if available)
   - Provide clear description
   - Add labels appropriately
3. **Get assignment**: Comment on issue to claim it
4. **Wait for approval** (for larger features)

### Step 2: Create a Branch

Follow branching conventions from `BRANCHING.md`:

```bash
# For features
git checkout {{DEV_BRANCH}}
git pull origin {{DEV_BRANCH}}
git checkout -b feature/PROJ-XXX-description

# For bug fixes
git checkout -b bugfix/PROJ-XXX-description
```

### Step 3: Make Changes

**Best Practices**:
- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Follow existing code style
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation as needed

**Don't**:
- Mix unrelated changes
- Reformat entire files
- Add unrelated fixes
- Commit commented-out code

### Step 4: Add Tests

**Test Requirements**:
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Aim for {{COVERAGE_TARGET}}% coverage
- Include edge cases

**Test Types**:
```bash
# Unit tests
{{RUN_UNIT_TESTS}}

# Integration tests
{{RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS}}

# E2E tests (if applicable)
{{RUN_E2E_TESTS}}
```

### Step 5: Run Tests

Before committing, verify all tests pass:

```bash
{{RUN_ALL_TESTS}}
```

**Check coverage**:
```bash
{{RUN_COVERAGE}}
```

### Step 6: Commit Changes

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>"
```

**Examples**:
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication

Implements OAuth2 flow with support for Google and GitHub providers.
Includes token refresh logic and session management.

Closes PROJ-123"

git commit -m "fix(api): resolve race condition in user creation

The user creation endpoint had a race condition when multiple requests
arrived simultaneously. Added transaction locking to prevent duplicates.

Fixes PROJ-456"

git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions

Added troubleshooting section for common setup issues.

Relates to PROJ-789"
```

**Commit Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style/formatting
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding tests
- `build`: Build system changes
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Step 7: Push to Remote

```bash
git push origin feature/PROJ-XXX-description
```

### Step 8: Create Pull Request

## Coding Standards

### Code Style

{{CODE_STYLE_GUIDE}}

### Linting

Run linter before committing:

```bash
{{RUN_LINTER}}
```

**Auto-fix** (if supported):
```bash
{{AUTO_FIX_COMMAND}}
```

### Formatting

Use consistent formatting:

```bash
{{FORMAT_COMMAND}}
```

### Naming Conventions

**Variables**:
- Use descriptive names
- Follow {{NAMING_CONVENTION}} convention
- Avoid single-letter names (except loops)

**Functions/Methods**:
- Use verb-noun format
- Be descriptive and specific
- Keep functions focused (single responsibility)

**Files**:
- {{FILE_NAMING_CONVENTION}}
- Group related functionality
- Keep file size reasonable

### Best Practices

**DO**:
- ✅ Write self-documenting code
- ✅ Keep functions small and focused
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully
- ✅ Use meaningful variable names
- ✅ Add comments for complex logic
- ✅ Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- ✅ Consider edge cases

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Leave TODO comments without issues
- ❌ Commit debugging code
- ❌ Ignore linter warnings
- ❌ Use magic numbers
- ❌ Nest code too deeply
- ❌ Mix concerns
- ❌ Skip error handling
