## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Installation Security

**DO**:
- ✅ Download from official sources only
- ✅ Verify checksums/signatures
- ✅ Use official package managers
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated
- ✅ Review installation scripts

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Download from untrusted sources
- ❌ Skip signature verification
- ❌ Use outdated versions
- ❌ Ignore security warnings
- ❌ Run with unnecessary privileges

#### Configuration Security

**Secure Defaults**:
{{SECURE_CONFIGURATION}}

**Environment Variables**:
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable 2FA where available

**File Permissions**:
{{FILE_PERMISSIONS}}

#### Runtime Security

**Monitoring**:
{{MONITORING_RECOMMENDATIONS}}

**Logging**:
- Enable security logging
- Review logs regularly
- Set up alerts for suspicious activity
- Retain logs for {{LOG_RETENTION}}

### For Contributors

#### Secure Development

**Code Security**:
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize outputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Avoid eval() and similar functions
- Handle errors securely (no sensitive data in errors)

**Authentication & Authorization**:
- Use established libraries
- Implement least privilege principle
- Validate sessions properly
- Use secure password hashing
- Implement rate limiting

**Data Protection**:
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use TLS for data in transit
- Never log sensitive information
- Implement data retention policies
- Follow GDPR/privacy regulations

**Dependencies**:
- Review dependencies before adding
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor for security advisories
- Use dependency scanning tools
- Pin dependency versions

#### Security Testing

**Required Tests**:
```bash
# Dependency scanning
{{DEPENDENCY_SCAN_COMMAND}}

# SAST (Static Analysis)
{{SAST_COMMAND}}

# Linting for security issues
{{SECURITY_LINT_COMMAND}}
```

**Recommended Tests**:
- Input validation testing
- Authentication/authorization testing
- Injection attack testing
- XSS prevention testing
- CSRF protection testing
