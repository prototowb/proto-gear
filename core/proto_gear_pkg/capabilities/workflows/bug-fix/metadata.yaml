usage_notes: |
  Systematic bug fix workflow combining debugging with TDD practices.
  CRITICAL: Always write regression test before fixing the bug (RED phase).

  Steps: reproduce bug → write failing test → debug → fix → verify → commit.
  Requires both debugging and testing skills to function properly.
