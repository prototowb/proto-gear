usage_notes: |
  Refactoring changes code structure without changing behavior.
  CRITICAL: Requires comprehensive tests to ensure behavior preservation.

  Common patterns: extract method, rename, move, simplify conditionals.
  Always run tests after each refactoring step. Never refactor without tests.
