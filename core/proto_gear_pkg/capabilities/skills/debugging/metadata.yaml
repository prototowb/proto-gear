usage_notes: |
  Systematic debugging uses the scientific method: observe, hypothesize, test, repeat.
  Patterns include divide-and-conquer, rubber duck debugging, and binary search.

  Works best combined with testing skills for writing regression tests.
  Essential for bug-fix and hotfix workflows.
