usage_notes: |
  Test-Driven Development is a core practice that benefits most development tasks.
  Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle: write failing test, make it pass, then improve code.

  Works best when combined with feature-development or bug-fix workflows.
  Requires TESTING.md to exist in the project for project-specific test conventions.

  Testing pyramid: 70% unit tests, 20% integration tests, 10% E2E tests.
  Target overall coverage: 70%+ for production code.
