## Framework Activation

This project is now integrated with ProtoGear's AI agent workflow system.

When this file is read by an AI agent, it should:

1. Analyze the current project structure
2. Understand the technology stack in use
3. Provide context-aware development assistance
4. Follow the project's established patterns5. Follow branching and commit conventions in BRANCHING.md

## Project Structure

Project contains: core, dev, docs, examples, scripts, tests, __pycache__

## Agent Configuration

Proto Gear uses an adaptive hybrid system with 4 permanent core agents and 2 flexible
sprint-specific slots that adapt based on current development needs.

### Core Agents (Always Active)
- **Backend Agent**: Server-side logic, APIs, database integration
- **Frontend Agent**: UI/UX, component development, styling
- **Testing Agent**: Test creation, coverage analysis, quality assurance
- **DevOps Agent**: CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure management

### Flex Agents (Sprint-Based)
Automatically configured based on sprint type:
- Documentation Agent
- Performance Agent
- Security Agent
- Refactoring Agent

## Workflow Commands

```bash
# Initialize agent templates (already done)
pg init

# Show help and documentation
pg help
```

## Next Steps

1. Review this file to understand agent patterns and workflows
2. Check PROJECT_STATUS.md for current project state3. Review BRANCHING.md for Git workflow conventions
4. Review TESTING.md for TDD patterns
5. Start development with AI agents reading templates
